=Change Log - Version: 0.2.2 - Build 31 - Beta=

  * Fix: Issue with Save As... function not using the file name supplied by the user in the Save As... Dialog.  Was using current config file name instead... which in the case of a new configuration would result in an unhandled exception - Thanks augie!!!

  * Change: Messages Window can now be closed using F7 key.
  * Change: Now a single instance application (attempting to start HFM.exe again won't yield an exception, just a dialog telling you the app is already running).
  * Change: User specific UI settings like log file splitter location, column indexes, and column sort are now being saved at the time they are changed... not just on application shutdown.

  * Enhancement: HTML Summary now respects the 'Allways List Offline Clients Last' option.
  * Enhancement: Add options to turn on/off the search for Duplicate User/Machine ID and Project (R/C/G) (HTML Summary reflects these changes as well).

=Change Log - Version: 0.2.2 - Build 30 - Beta=

  * Fix: FTP Client Type Download on Linux (Mono).  
  * Fix: Frame calculations 'AllFrames' and 'EffectiveRate' were not persisting from session to session, would default back to 'LastThreeFrames'.  
  * Fix: Allow special keystrokes (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, etc) in Numeric only textboxes.  
  * Fix: Formatting error with links to individual clients on the standard web summary.html page (client links would not work when used with Firefox on Linux... Windows based browsers were fine)
  * Fix: Show NotifyIcon (sys tray icon) after Form has been shown (user reported unhandled exception when double-clicking on Icon before main Form is shown).  
  * Fix: Current UnitInfo states now being saved correctly when leaving the current configuration (not just on shutdown).

  * Change: Status Color Green is Color.Green (lighter) in lieu of Color.DarkGreen.  
  * Change: Halting lookup of unknown protein description when doing Web Generation.  Eliminates "HFM.Helpers.ProteinData.DescriptionFromURL threw exception..." messages that appear unnecessarily.
  * Change: Host Configuration - Validate 'Local Path' after returning from the Folder Browse dialog.  
  * Change: Added check for EOC XML Stats 'Status' to limit the number of XML data retrievals when the stats do not change (like what usually happens at 12 noon update).  
  * Change: Time based column alternate formatting to use leading 0 (i.e. 00min 00sec).  
  * Change: Don't show Save Dialog when user selects a "Save" operation and no Filename and no Clients are defined.
  * Change: Added error dialog when Import FahMon Configuration yields no added clients.  
  * Change: Added error dialog when Configuration Load yields no added clients.

  * Enhancement: Add support for finding duplicate Project (R/C/G) and User + Machine ID combinations (HTML Summary reflects these changes as well).

=Change Log - Version: 0.2.2 - Build 28 - Beta=

  * Enhancement: Add User Stats Data Display from EOC XML along with option to enable or disable the display.
  * Enhancement: HTML Summary - User Name cells as Orange background when User Name does not match the User Name configured in the Preferences.
  * Enhancement: Added five new style sheets for more Website color options.
  * Enhancement: Conversation time of HTML Upload via FTP is now being logged (Info Level).

  * Change: Each HTML page now has a link to the HFM.NET Google Code page.  Using alternating colors on Overview page.
  * Change: Small tweak to the LogParser.cs when CheckForProjectID() writes the warning message "Failed to parse the Project (R/C/G) values from '{0}'" generated by SetProjectID().  There was no indication of which client log failed the parse and what value generated the warning.
  * Change: Protein Information on the Benchmarks Form now in text boxes (just aesthetics).  Fix the spelling of "Preferred" on the Benchmarks Form.
  * Change: All Forms are now being set with DoubleBuffered = true in an attempt to further alleviate UI lag issues.

  * Fix: Grid columns not appearing in default order on some users systems.  Manually create the columns and bind.  Allows column headers to be labeled in a more visually friendly manner (i.e. they can have spaces now).

=Change Log - Version: 0.2.1 - Build 23 - Beta=

  * Enhancement: Major upgrade to the HTML Summary page.  Now outputs a table with the same columns as the main HFM UI including the proper status color.
  * Enhancement: Add Mobile Overview (mobile.html) and Mobile Summary (mobilesummary.html) Web Generation.  
  * Enhancement: Allow website to be uploaded via FTP when a FTP style URL is input as the Target Folder (i.e. ftp://username:password@ftp.com/FolderName/).
  * Enhancement: Added ToolTip for the Status column that shows the text representation of the current Status.  
  * Enhancement: Added check of Username and Team vs. the configured Username and Team (will show Orange with ToolTip if incorrect).  
  * Enhancement: Added Preferences setting to control how many decimals are shown in PPD calculations (0 to 5 decimal places).  

  * Change: Add the user input processor MHz as a column.
  * Change: Remove the Team column and Combine it with the Username column (will require you to reset your column widths).
  * Change: Reference the correct casing of the CSS files, and add code to make sure previous versions of HFM will still find the right CSS selection... however, to "fix" the entry in the Preferences the user will need to accept the Preferences Form after upgrading.  This change for the casing is necessary to support running on Mono in a Linux environment.

  * Fix: Preferences Dialog - add code to allow only digits to be input in either Minutes field, the EOC ID, Team Number, or Proxy Port field. 
  * Fix: Bug that caused the main grid Sort Order to be lost after minimizing the main UI window.
  * Fix: Web Generation code now wrapped in try/catch, if the web generation would fail the timers would not be reset and thus HFM would stop refreshing the client data.  

  * Suggested Setting (Linux): Try "xdg-open" for logfile viewer and file explorer.

=Change Log - Version: 0.2.0 - Build 20 - Beta=

  * Fix: Only accumulate Completed and Failed counts on most recent unit parse.
  * Fix: Final fix for resuming from a long pause.  I think I've got it licked now.
  * Fix: Parsing of frame percentage from older clients like v5.02.  
  * Fix: Parsing Frame 0 - which doesn't happen with GPUs and rarely on SMP.  However, Standard clients often report Frame 0.
  * Fix: Unhandled exception that occurs when viewing the benchmarks window with no clients loaded (actually no client selected).

  * Change: Setup frmPreferences to only show the WebBrowser control when not running under Mono Framework.  
  * Change: Patched the main Project Resources.resx file for case sensitivity.

=Change Log - Version: 0.2.0 - Build 18 - Beta=

  * Fix: Fixed the problem with completed units being written to the CompletedUnits.csv file with no frame time or PPD.
  * Fix: Fixed problem with determining client 'Status' when a client resumes from a paused state (specifically a very long pause).
  * Fix: Pull the last Username and Team ID string from the FAHlog.txt file, not the first.
  * Fix: Fixed 'AllFrames' calculation.
  * Fix: Wrap the FAHLogStats.NET Link process start on the About Dialog in a try/catch.

  * Change: Use Path.Combine and remove hard coded "\\" platform specific Path Delimiter characters.
  * Change: Change log file name defaults to their accurate, case-sensitive names "FAHlog.txt" and "unitinfo.txt".  
  * Change: Minor UI tweaks to the Benchmarks Form Layout.
  * Change: Replace Forms based timers with System.Timers.Timer objects (no need to Invoke calls anymore).
  * Change: Corrected "\\" to "//" in the commented logo areas of the Overview.xml and Summary.xml files.
  * Change: Changed the HTML Output "Page rendered" strings to read "Page rendered by HFM.NET on...", also reformatted the xslt files.

  * Enhancement: Add "Auto Save Configuration" option.
  * Enhancement: Add support for detecting clients as Hung before they have generated a valid frame time.

=Change Log - Version: 0.2.0 - Build 17 - Beta=

  * Enhancement: MAJOR REWORK!!!  Added support for Benchmarking Work Units.  
  * Enhancement: Added ability to save the currently in progress UnitInfo objects on application exit.  This allows the state of the last known projects in progress to be restored the next time the application starts.  
  * Enhancement: Added output of completed units to CompletedUnits.csv file.  Allows external analysis of completed work.  Preliminary at this point, still needs a little work I think.
  * Enhancement: The benchmarking changes yield the functionality to show frame times (PPD, etc) as 'AllFrames' and also 'EffectiveRate' in addition to 'LastFrame' and 'LastThreeFrames'.
  * Enhancement: Added option to Import FahMon style ClientsTab.txt files as a HFM Configuration (used file from v2.3.99.1 to test).

  * Fix: Fixed HUGE BUG in the frmMessages.UpdateMessages() routine which resulted in full UI deadlock (use BeginInvoke in lieu of Invoke).  
  * Fix: Unit DownloadTime now handled correctly for clients marked as 'Client is on Virtual Machine'.  
  * Fix: Fixed small bug where a DirectoryPathSeparator character was being added to the end of a PathInstance path every time the TextBox was left (added in Rev 15 - no build produced).

  * Change: Add StringOps.cs Class to facilitate validation and parsing of Client Instance data strings.  
  * Change: Update ClientInstance Http and Ftp download routines (these are now verified working).
  * Change: Add "Wrapper" classes (that specify DoubleBuffered = true) for the most commonly used controls in an effort to further reduce UI lag.
  * Change: Host Instance Add/Edit Dialog got a much needed work over. Now using StringOps for input validation.  
  * Change: Allow the user to continue with Client Input Parameters that fail validation if they choose to do so (not recommended).

=Change Log - Version: 0.1.1 - Build 14 - Beta=

  * Fix: Corrected on error in the log parsing that was causing SMP A1 Core (and likely Standard Client Cores) to fail parsing.  Resulting in the clients status staying yellow.

=Change Log - Version: 0.1.1 - Build 13 - Beta=

  * Fix: Set DoubleBuffering on the DataGridView to fix extremely slow painting on XP while GPU2 is active.  If this doesn't fix the problem of slow UI response, then nothing will.

  * Change: Switch back to using GDI for text rendering. It just looks better.

=Change Log - Version: 0.1.1 - Build 12 - Beta=

  * Fix: Change text rendering engine to GDI+.  This fixes the extreme lag issue experienced on XP.  Note: There is still some lag when GPU2 is active, but HFM is now totally usable while also running GPU2 on XP based on my testing.

  * Change: Increase maximum UnitInfo.txt size to 1 Megabyte.
  * Change: Fix host path regex to accept fully qualified server names such as my.server.com (patch from smartcat99s).

  * Enhancement: Add capture of Username and Team to the main grid.
  * Enhancement: Allow the log file window to be sized.

=Change Log - Version: 0.1.1 - Build 11 - Beta=

  * Fix: "No Prompt on Exit" after configuration has changed when exiting via the "X" on the main window.
  * Fix: Large 'Progress' values being parsed from UnitInfo.txt file.
  * Fix: Halt downloading of overly large UnitInfo.txt files (Local Clients Only).
  * Fix: Client status shows as 'Hung' (Red) when a client's log file time stamp is ahead by 1 hour.  Setting an 'Offset' value of 60 minutes will now correct this.

  * Change: Set default Stanford Project download to psummary.html, not psummaryC.html.
  * Change: Increase Client 'Offset' minimum and maximum values to +/- 720 minutes (12 hours).
  * Change: Messages Window Font to "Courier New" (fixed width) and made text read only.
  * Change: Format debug messages with message type identifier (" ", "X", "!", "-", "+").
  * Change: A lot of code realignment and changing of Debug Message Levels.

  * Enhancement: Add Debug Level for Logging/Messages as a user defined setting (Preferences -> Defaults).  Use this setting to effect the level of detail shown in the Log File and Messages Window.
  * Enhancement: Added support for missing FAH Cores currently not in production (GBGROMACS, QMD, GROST, DGROMACSB) and ATI & NVIDIA Development Cores.
  * Enhancement: Auto download new Project data when Project cannot be identified using cached Project data.
  * Enhancement: Only download FAHLog.txt when it has changed vs. the currently cached copy (Local Clients Only).  Can speed up retrieval cycle, especially when set to very low intervals.
  * Enhancement: Output 'Status' Determination data when using 'Verbose' Debug Level.  If you have clients continually showing as 'Hung' (Red) this output will help me debug the problem with the time stamps coming from the local machine vs. the hung clients.
